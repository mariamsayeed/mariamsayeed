👋 Hello, fellow developers! I'm [Mariam], a passionate learner and blockchain enthusiast with a focus on Solidity smart contract development.

💻 I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I leverage to create intuitive and user-friendly web interfaces.

📚 In addition to front-end development, I have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. I believe that a solid grasp of these concepts is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

🌟 My current area of exploration and is Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. I love the challenge of developing decentralized applications (dApps) and exploring the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize industries.

🚀 As an advocate for open-source, I actively contribute to projects related to blockchain and smart contract development. I believe in the power of collaboration and the collective wisdom of the developer community.

📬 Let's connect and collaborate! I'm open to exciting opportunities, engaging in discussions, and working on projects that leverage my skills. Feel free to reach out to me.
